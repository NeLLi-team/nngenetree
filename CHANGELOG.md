## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-30

### üöÄ Major Migration - Nextflow Implementation

This release completely migrates NNGeneTree from Snakemake to Nextflow, providing better scalability, resume capabilities, and execution reports.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Workflow Engine
- **Nextflow Pipeline**: Complete rewrite using Nextflow DSL2
  - Modular process architecture in `modules/` directory
  - Built-in resume capability with `-resume` flag
  - Automatic execution reports (HTML timeline, DAG, trace)
  - Better cloud integration (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud ready)
  - Improved SLURM integration via `conf/slurm.config`

#### Execution
- **Unified Run Script**: Single `run_nextflow.sh` for all execution modes
  - `bash run_nextflow.sh test` - Test mode with verification
  - `bash run_nextflow.sh <dir> local` - Local execution
  - `bash run_nextflow.sh <dir> slurm` - SLURM cluster
  - Built-in output verification for test mode
- **Pixi Test Task**: `pixi run test` for quick testing

#### Features
- **Full Taxonomy in CSV**: `placement_results.csv` now includes complete taxonomy strings
  - Changed from domain-only to full lineage (e.g., "Bacteria;Bacillati;Bacillota;...")
- **Standardized Output**: All outputs now use `{input_dir}_output` pattern
- **Better Documentation**: Updated README with Nextflow-specific instructions

### üîß Changed

#### Configuration
- **Nextflow Config**: Moved from `workflow/config.txt` to `nextflow.config`
  - Profile-based execution (test, local, slurm)
  - Cleaner parameter override syntax
  - Resource configuration in config blocks
- **Script Location**: All scripts moved from `workflow/scripts/` to `bin/`
- **Query Prefixes**: Added documentation explaining example vs actual test values

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

#### Legacy Files
- Removed all Snakemake execution scripts:
  - `run.sh` (Snakemake)
  - `run_container.sh` (Snakemake container)
  - `run_slurm.sh` (Snakemake SLURM)
  - `run_nextflow_test.sh` (merged into main script)
- Removed Snakemake-specific pixi tasks
- Cleaned up obsolete log files

### üêõ Fixed
- **Java Version**: Scripts now use `pixi run nextflow` to ensure Java 11+ from pixi environment
- **Path Consistency**: All documentation updated with correct `bin/` paths
- **Output Deduplication**: Single output directory pattern across all modes

### üìö Documentation
- Updated README.md with Nextflow usage
- Updated NEXTFLOW_README.md with comprehensive guide
- Added query_prefixes configuration explanation
- Removed all Snakemake references from user-facing docs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- Snakemake workflow no longer maintained (available in `nngenetree-snk` branch)
- Command-line syntax changed from `snakemake --config` to `nextflow run main.nf --param`
- Configuration file format changed from text to Groovy/Nextflow config
- Output directory naming changed from `*_nngenetree` to `*_output`

### üîÑ Migration Notes
For users migrating from v1.0 (Snakemake):
1. Old Snakemake version preserved in branch `nngenetree-snk`
2. Update scripts to use `run_nextflow.sh` instead of `run.sh`
3. Convert `workflow/config.txt` settings to `nextflow.config` format
4. Update output directory references from `*_nngenetree` to `*_output`

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-29

### üéâ Major Release - Production Ready

This is the first stable release of NNGeneTree with significant improvements to dependency management, workflow reliability, and user experience.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Dependency Management
