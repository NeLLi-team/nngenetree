## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-29

### üéâ Major Release - Production Ready

This is the first stable release of NNGeneTree with significant improvements to dependency management, workflow reliability, and user experience.

### ‚ú® Added

#### Dependency Management
- **Pixi Package Manager**: Replaced conda with Pixi for faster, more reliable dependency management
  - Single `pixi.toml` file for all dependencies and tasks
  - Automatic environment setup with `pixi install`
  - Lockfile support for reproducible environments
  - Integrated task runner: `pixi run <task>`

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **Fast Test Suite**: Added small test database (131 sequences) for rapid validation
  - `test_db/` directory with pre-built BLAST database
  - `pixi run test-fast`: Complete pipeline test in minutes
  - Test configuration: `workflow/config_test.txt`

#### Pipeline Features
- **Sequence Deduplication**: New `combine_and_deduplicate.py` script prevents duplicate sequences in phylogenetic trees
  - Removes duplicate sequence IDs
  - Detects and removes identical sequences with different IDs
  - Detailed deduplication statistics in logs
- **Phylogenetic Placement**: Enhanced neighbor extraction with taxonomy
  - `extract_phylogenetic_neighbors.py`: Extract neighbors for specific query prefixes
  - Detailed placement results in JSON and CSV formats
  - Combined placement results across all samples
- **BLAST Processing**: Improved hit processing and validation
  - `process_blast_for_extraction.py`: Deduplicate hits across queries
  - Checkpoint validation before sequence extraction
  - Better error handling and logging

#### Documentation
- **Comprehensive README**: Complete rewrite with clear usage examples
  - Quick start guide
  - Configuration override examples
  - Detailed pipeline workflow diagrams
  - All functional Pixi tasks documented
- **Project Guidelines**: Added `CLAUDE.md` for AI assistant integration
- **Impact Tracking**: Complete `.claude/impact.json` for change documentation

#### OrthoFinder Integration
- **Genome-Scale Analysis**: New `orthofinder_preprocess.py` script
  - Process multiple genomes through OrthoFinder
  - Filter orthogroups by target proteins
  - Automatic FASTA file generation for each orthogroup
  - Direct integration with NNGeneTree pipeline

### üîß Changed

#### Configuration
- **Standardized Output**: All outputs now use `{input_dir}_nngenetree` pattern
  - Consistent naming across all workflows
  - Removed confusing `test_output` override
  - Clear override mechanism via `--config output_dir=custom`

#### Pipeline Tasks
- **Streamlined Commands**: Reduced from 21 to 12 functional tasks
  - Removed non-functional tasks (container, pytest, dag)
  - Removed tasks with problematic positional arguments
  - All remaining tasks are tested and functional
  - Clear documentation for direct script usage

#### Workflow
- **Resource Configuration**: Improved resource allocation for SLURM
  - Per-rule thread, memory, and time specifications
  - Better default values for cluster execution
  - Disk space allocation for large alignments

### üêõ Fixed

- **Duplicate Sequences**: Fixed tree-building failures caused by duplicate sequences
  - Self-hits now properly filtered during BLAST processing
  - Identical sequences removed before alignment
  - Comprehensive logging of deduplication statistics

- **Path Handling**: Fixed relative vs absolute path issues in workflow
  - Consistent use of absolute paths throughout
  - Container-compatible path management
  - Proper working directory handling

### üìù Documentation

- **Configuration Guide**: Added comprehensive config override examples
- **Task Reference**: Complete table of all functional Pixi tasks
- **Version Badge**: Added GitHub link to README badge
- **OrthoFinder Workflow**: Documented genome-scale analysis workflows

### üóëÔ∏è Removed

- **Example Directory**: Replaced with `test/` for consistency
- **Container Documentation**: Removed ~90 lines of untested container docs
- **Non-functional Tasks**: Removed dag, build-container, run-container, pytest tasks
- **Positional Arg Tasks**: Removed analyze, visualize, ortho-* convenience commands

### üîê Infrastructure

- **Git Workflow**: Added completion guard and hooks for code quality
- **Impact Tracking**: All new files documented in `.claude/impact.json`
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging infrastructure in `logs/` directory

### üìä Statistics

- **Files Added**: 50+ new files (test database, scripts, configs, documentation)
- **Lines Changed**: ~600 lines modified since v0.9.0
- **Documentation**: README grew from ~350 to ~450 lines of useful content
- **Tasks**: Reduced from 21 to 12 functional, tested tasks

## [0.9.0] - 2025-09-28
